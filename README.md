# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Madness
A silly rock paper scissors game that logs data and lets you simulate additional matches

The game first has you play with an interactive opponent that responds to the patterns of your responses. While you play, your responses are logged to calculate how common different sequences of plays are in your data. Then, after you're done playing it will let you use the probabilities of your different moves and simulate how you would do against different opponents with their own portfolios.
